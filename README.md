# Prognosis AI : An Advanced Medical Prediction System

This project will detect seven major diseases under one platform which are as follows:

1. Covid 19 Detection
2. Brain tumor detection
3. Breast Cancer detection
4. Alzheimer detection
5. Diabetes detection
6. Pneumonia detection
7. Heart disease detection

Prognosis AI is a cutting-edge medical prediction system designed to provide accurate disease prognosis by leveraging the power of Deep Learning and Machine Learning algorithms. By incorporating state-of-the-art techniques, including Random Forest, XGBoost and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), our system can analyze user-provided medical reports with remarkable precision, enabling timely and precise disease predictions.

## Tools and Technologies
Python - Jupyter Notebook (TensorFlow for Model Training)
Flask Web Framework (for Backend)
Google Firebase (for Real-Time Storage and Firestore Database)
HTML, CSS, and JS (for Frontend)
Runtime
Python v3.8.10

## Dataset
The dataset for the project was gathered from multiple sources. Two of them are as follows:

Chest X-ray images (1000 images) were obtained from: https://github.com/ieee8023/covid-chestxray-dataset
CT Scan images (750 images) were obtained from: https://github.com/UCSD-AI4H/COVID-CT/tree/master/Data-split
80% of the images were used for training the models and the remaining 20% for testing.
